A dataset for the evaluation of Move Method recommendation algorithms. 

This repository is structured the following way:

-> <project_name> - main folder with all data about this project

    -> <project_name> - git submodule with actual project
   
    -> patches - folder containing patch to apply and physically move methods in project
   
    -> *.csv - files describing move method refactorings data (for more information see https://github.com/ml-in-programming/MoveMethodGenerator/)
   
    -> log - log of utilities for move method refactorings generation
